# MofDin

MofDin is a 2D game made in Flutter with Flame Engine.

## Why?
I have always wanted to create a game and always went in love with 2D RPG games, like Tibia for example. And a long time ago, I wrote a fantasy story, but I never can put it into practice.

Now, after a long long time, I decided to make it. I have a little time to learn Flame and practice my Flutter/Dart skills.

## The begin
I’m learning yet, so in the beginning, the sprites are of Naruto DSI, which I got on the sprites-resources site. But in the future, I’ll replace sprites with mine, according to what I’ll learn, as the game progress advances.

I’ll try to code every day, but the project is to improve my skills with game development (developing one, in this case, haha) and to have fun with the challenges that it’s to do this project.
